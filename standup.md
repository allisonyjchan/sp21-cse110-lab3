# Standup Template
We will try to conduct standups through 15 minute Zoom meetings, but if not, then they will be done over Slack in a dedicated channel for standups. There will be a set 15 minute time where everyone will post in the channel and interact with each other through text. Those who happen to miss it may comment on other posts throughout the day responding to those who call for help and giving their own reports.

# Questions
## How is my mood and energy today?
## What did I work on between the last stand up and now?
## What am I going to focus on today?
## What am I having trouble with and would like some help with?
